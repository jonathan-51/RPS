Wanted to learn python so I can ultimately learn more about AI. Planning to build a Rock Paper Scissors game and train to bot to become the ultimate computer when it comes to RPS. Before I get too ahead of myself, I first programmed a simple RPS game using the crude style of if's and elif's, and the random function.

Today I wanted to be able to play multiple rounds in one game, since playing only one round is boring. I achieved this by implementing a while loop based on how many wins the user or the computer has **left** until they win. I first set the variable to 2, and after each round, the number of wins left would decrease by 1 based on who won that round. This would loop until either side has won twice, so a best of 3. I looped this via while loop, where if both sides have a non-zero number of wins left, it would continue looping; if the either side wins by 2, which causes its respective variable to decrease to 0, and would break the loop and cause the game to finish.

There were many minor problems that I encountered during this implementation that were quickly solved by just running code in my mind. An example was that I used 'or' instead of 'and' in the while loop which meant that as soon as I ran the program, it would immediately finish, but now even if I do use 'or' instead of 'and', nothing would change. Another minor problem I encountered was that the variables I was using in the while loop were unassigned, instead I was trying to assign them inside the while loop. I think the only reason I encountered this problem in the first place was because I was trying to optimmize my code while trying to build it at the same time, and so I was limiting the number of variables I was using. I solved this by just using more variables.

Another feature that I implemented was the ability to play again without running the code again. This was pretty easy since all I needed to do was wrap my existing code in a while loop, create a variable that tracks a number, if they input "yes, they do want to play again", then the variable wouldn't change; however, if they decided to not play again, it would alter the variable's number causing the loop to end. I think the reason why I was able to implement this feature so quickly and without much problem was because it was pretty similar in nature to my first implementation of the day, and so if I implemented this play again feature first instead of the best of 3, it would of been the other way round.
